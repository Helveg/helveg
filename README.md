### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on lots of projects related to my PhD in neuroscience!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about cycling, hiking or doing things you shouldn't do in Python.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: GitHub notifications are my go-to drugs.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they (or die/hun in my native language, Dutch)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Whales have tiny feet in their skeleton and lobsters don't answer when you ask them for their age.

Some of my projects are in disarray or only up to snuff for personal use, but I'm highly susceptible to external motivation. If you're interested in any of them feel free to open an issue and I will be immediatly available to polish up my projects for your use!
